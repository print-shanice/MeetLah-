## 🔥 Monthly Streak System

### What is it?
The Monthly Streak tracks how many consecutive months your group has met up. Meeting at least once per month keeps the streak alive!

### How it works
1. **Automatic Tracking:** When you create a meetup event, the system automatically checks if it's a new month
2. **Streak Increment:** If you met last month and meet this month, your streak increases by 1
3. **Streak Reset:** If you skip a month, the streak resets to 1 on your next meetup
4. **Record Keeping:** The system tracks both your current streak and your longest streak ever

### Where to see it
- **Sidebar:** The streak display appears at the top of the sidebar
- **Stats Shown:**
  - Current streak (with fire emoji 🔥 when active)
  - Longest streak record
  - Last meetup month
  - Achievement badges

### Achievements
- 🥉 **3-Month Warrior:** Keep a 3+ month streak
- 🥈 **Half-Year Hero:** Reach 6 consecutive months
- 🥇 **Year-Long Legend:** Achieve 12 months in a row
- 💎 **2-Year Champion:** Maintain 24+ months
- 📈 **Record Holder:** When current streak = longest streak

### Tips
- Create at least one meetup event each month
- The streak updates instantly when you create a meetup
- Personal events don't count - only meetup events affect the streak
- All calendar members benefit from the same streak

## ⏰ Punctuality Punisher

### What is it?
A fun feature that assigns random punishments to friends who arrive late to meetups!

### How it works

#### Step 1: Mark Attendance (After Meetup)
1. Click on a past meetup event in the calendar
2. The attendance modal appears automatically
3. For each participant, mark them as:
   - ✅ **On Time** - They arrived punctually
   - ⏰ **Late** - They were late

#### Step 2: Assign Punishments
1. After marking attendance, click "Assign Random Punishments"
2. The system randomly selects a punishment for each late person
3. Punishments are fun and lighthearted, like:
   - Buy everyone bubble tea 🧋
   - Do 20 push-ups right now 💪
   - Sing a song of the group's choice 🎤
   - Share an embarrassing story 😳

#### Step 3: Complete Punishments
1. Late participants can see their assigned punishment
2. They can mark it as completed once done
3. Everyone can see who has completed their punishments

### Punishment Examples
The system includes 20+ creative punishments:
- Social: Buy treats, take embarrassing photos
- Physical: Push-ups, burpees, planks
- Creative: Sing, dance, do impressions
- Silly: Wear a silly hat, speak in an accent
- And more!

### Privacy & Fun
- Attendance marking is collaborative - anyone can mark it
- Punishments are meant to be fun, not mean
- The group decides together if someone was "really" late
- It's all about encouraging punctuality in a playful way!

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I be in multiple calendars?**
A: Yes! You can join as many calendars as you want.

**Q: What happens if I'm late to multiple meetups?**
A: Each meetup gets its own punishment assignment. Better start being punctual! 😄

**Q: Can I delete someone else's events?**
A: No, you can only delete your own personal events. Only the meetup creator can delete meetup events.

**Q: What if we meet twice in one month?**
A: Great! But the streak only counts months, not number of meetups. One meetup per month is enough.

**Q: Can I customize the punishment list?**
A: Not currently, but it's a planned feature! The default list has 20+ fun options.

**Q: Is my data private?**
